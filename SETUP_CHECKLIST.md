## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup (RUN THESE SQL STATEMENTS)

### Step 1: Run Missing SQL
Copy and paste the contents of `MISSING_SQL_COMPLETE.sql` into your Supabase SQL Editor and execute.

This will create:
- ‚úÖ `contact_submissions` table
- ‚úÖ `profiles` table  
- ‚úÖ `order_status_history` table
- ‚úÖ `system_settings` table
- ‚úÖ `email_queue` table
- ‚úÖ Missing columns in `orders` table
- ‚úÖ All required RPC functions
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security policies
- ‚úÖ Database triggers
- ‚úÖ Performance indexes

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions
Follow the instructions in `DEPLOY_EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md` to deploy:
- ‚úÖ `paystack-webhook` function
- ‚úÖ `send-quote-email` function  
- ‚úÖ `manage-orders` function

### Step 3: Regenerate TypeScript Types
After applying SQL changes, regenerate your Supabase types:
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

## üîß Configuration Updates Needed

### Environment Variables
Update these in your production environment:
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
- `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your production Paystack public key
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` - Your production Paystack secret key (Edge Function env var)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend email API key (Edge Function env var)

### Company Settings
Update the company settings in your database via admin panel or SQL:
- Company name
- Company email  
- Company phone
- Company address
- Email from address
- Email from name

### Admin User Setup
Create your first admin user:
```sql
-- Replace with your actual email
SELECT make_user_admin('your-admin-email@company.com');
```
